**Objective:**
The aim of this course is to introduce and prepare participants to do quantitative academic work within the social sciences. As increasing emphasis in academics is being placed on the skills needed to effectively gather, handle, model, and analyze data as well as present results to a range of audiences, this course will provide participants with important tools for doing independent research. Furthermore, the skills taught in this course are also in high demand outside academia. Participants will be introduced to an effective workflow for doing effective quantitative research using the R programming language. R is a free (based on open source principles) statistical software package, which is supported by a very large international research community. The program can be used to do all types of statistical analyses.

**Content:**
A tentative outline of the course, subject to change, is below:

*Day 1:* Introduction to R, basics (reading/writing data, data cleaning, merging, types of data), functions, getting help when things donâ€™t work.
*Day 2:* Linear and binary choice models, panel data, interactions, standard errors, data visualization.
*Day 3:* Some combination of: working and visualizing spatial data, analyzing text data, web scraping, statistical learning.

My plan is to tailor the third day to the specific needs of the course participants. Therefore, if you're enrolled and have a preference for some subset of topics for the third day (or other topics not listed), please send me an email at sebastianbarfort@gmail.com.

**Format and Evaluation:**
The course will be very hands-on and will be a combination of lectures and practical instruction using R. Focus will be on giving participants hands-on experience doing actual analysis, and finish the course with a series of small scripts that can be used in the future. Practical exercises using real-world research examples from economics and political science will be assigned for each session.

**Literature:**
The core recommended book for the course is Grolemund & Wickham. (2016). *R for Data Science*. We will supplement with journal articles on data visualization in the social sciences, examples of applied work (primarily from economics and political science) and more technical aspects of programming from journals such as *Journal of Statistical Software* and the *R Journal*. As we're still deciding on the exact content of the last day, a full reading list will be provided when this is settled.

**Target group**
PhD students in social science (political science, sociology, economics)
